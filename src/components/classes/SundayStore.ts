class SundayStore extends Store {
  //may be redundant, but i like the idea
  //reason this may be usefull:
  //if we spesifically want to find only sunday stores,
  //we just search based on class, not on an arbitrary time-object inside each store-object. cleaner code.
  //this means the class serves a purpose, even though it is seemingly empty.
